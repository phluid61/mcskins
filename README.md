# Minecraft Skins

All of these skins were made by me, but some of them are dervied from
skins by other authors.  Skins with a name ending in "ish" are based
on known Minecraft celebrity skins (for example "sipsish" is based on
the skin commonly worn by Sips_)

They are divided into directories for each "character" they represent.
